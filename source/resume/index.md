title: Resume
---
Currently I'm teaching myself Programming, Maths and Computer Science. As a kid there was nothing more exciting to me than studying science! I loved physics in particular, but I also thouroughly enjoyed art! In college moved towards Film, and I later graduated in BA Film & Video Production at the University of Glamorgan. 

I'm massively into video games, particularly First Person Shooters. (By massively, I mean it!) I recently ran a clan in the MMOFPS PlanetSide 2, a 2012 remake of the 2003 game by SOE. I've played most of the old-school shooters, and currently enjoy a little Quake Live.

When it comes to games, I always focus. For me the most fun is immersing into a game, learning its nuances and becoming highly proficient.
