My name's Ferugi.

I'm a self taugh programmer currently working as an IT analyst, having previously studied Film & Video Production. 
I'm comfortable with a range of software tools and techniques, and *what I've found `really matters` above all else is being willing and able to learn.*

I get a thrill from learning and implementing new technologies.
Similarly, it's satisfying as hell to take an existing system and work in optimizations.

As much as I push myself to improve on a daily basis, I strive to encourage the same among my peers. 
Seeing the expressions on collegues faces when you cut gruling tasks from hours to minutes is it's own reward.

That said, it's all well and good pushing for the optimal solution, but in the end work needs to be done. 

My skillset includes:
* C#
* WPF
* ASP.NET
* Node.JS
* Javascript
* C

Coming from study in Film, I find my knowledge of creative techniques and tools can be invaluable. I'm also comfortable with:
* Photoshop & GIMP
* After Effects
* Audacity
* Blender 3D
