I have over 4 years of experience building front and back-end applications with frameworks such as Angular and .NET that serve users around the world. Iâ€™ve tackled challenges that include internationalization, performance, data-security, and have delivered best-practice solutions in architectures ranging from monolithic to microservice.
I believe in the strength of teamwork, and am a more than capable self-starter. I enjoy reviewing code and sharing knowledge. I write clean, understandable code that is built with a firm understanding of object orientated programming principles. 
Outside of work I keep up my development knowledge and connections through self-study and by  regularly attending developer meetups like [Brighton Alt.NET](http://brightonalt.net/), [.NET South East](http://www.dotnetsoutheast.co.uk/), and [Async](https://asyncjs.com/).
