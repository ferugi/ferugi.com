CharityJob is the UK's foremost job board for the non-profit and voluntary sectors. It has roles listed for over 20,000 organizations, hundreds of thousands of monthly visitors, and over 1.4 million registered candidates with a wide demographic.
Driven by my passion for modern and effective development, I brought updates and improvements to the existing technologies and practices at CharityJob. My highlights include:

- Leading a team to deliver a complete UI overhaul, implmenting a component based design system built using React and Storybook.
- Significantly improved and reduced CI & CD complexity across the business by implementing "release-flow" and allowing for single-build-multiple-deployment.
- Improving code quality in an existing React project through the incremental adoption of TypeScript, code quality enhancing measures such as ESLint, modernization of the existing Redux implementation, and significant reduction of build times from nearly an hour to under two minutes.
- Designed and applied extensible architecure to document anonymisation pipeline, then implemented AI image recognition to improve document anonymisation and image redaction.
- Improved auth experiences from both a techincal and user experience standpoint
