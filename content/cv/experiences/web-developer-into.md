I develop full-stack, secure, optimised, and internationalised websites and microservices serving users around the globe. I’ve worked on agile (Scrum) projects across the company's digital portfolio and am experienced in a broad array of modern development tools and methodologies. I’m continually recognised and rewarded as a high-performer, my highlights include:

* Rebuilding our core B2B offering with Angular, personally delivering key features such as the search page, university listing, and comparison pages, within narrow time constraints.
* Being entrusted to analyse, research, and then develop with Azure Durable Functions a secure and reliable pipeline to carry our company’s most crucial data.
* Providing technical leadership to new developers on the enrolment process project and assisting with their onboarding to the wider development team.
* Leading the way in sharing knowledge by delivering well-received presentations to my peers on topics such as ASP.NET Core configuration, web accessibility, GraphQL, and text parsing with C# parser combinators.
* Presenting to the wider IT department the demonstrable benefits that LaunchDarkly and feature flags have brought to our products.
* Discovering and highlighting several critical security issues in recently acquired third party code, which I reviewed and provided solutions for based on my experience with ASP.NET auth.
* Adding unit and integration tests to several projects, with special attention to high risk areas.
* Developing Azure DevOps build and release pipelines to create and enhance effective CI/CD workflows that ensure well maintained codebases and smooth application delivery.
* Being a respected team member and viewed by colleagues as a technical expert, in particular with .NET.
