With a market revenue of $260m and over 1800 employees internationally, INTO University Partnerships is a leader in providing education to students around the world. At INTO I built full-stack, secure, and optimised, websites and microservices that served users with digitally diverse requirements. I worked in agile (Scrum) projects across the company's digital portfolio and experienced a broad array of modern development tools and methodologies. I received continually recognition and rewarded as a high-performer. My highlights include:

* Rebuilding our core B2B offering with Angular, personally delivering key features such as the search page, university listing, and comparison pages, within narrow time constraints.
* Being entrusted to analyse, research, and then develop with Azure Durable Functions a secure and reliable pipeline to carry our companyâ€™s most crucial data.
* Providing technical leadership to new developers on the enrolment process project and assisting with their onboarding to the wider development team.
* Leading the way in sharing knowledge by delivering well-received presentations to my peers on topics such as ASP.NET Core configuration, web accessibility, GraphQL, and using C# parser combinators.
* Presenting to the wider IT department (~100 employees) the demonstrable benefits that LaunchDarkly and feature flags have brought to our products.
* Discovering and highlighting several critical security issues in recently acquired third party code, which I reviewed and provided solutions for based on my experience with ASP.NET auth.
* Adding unit and integration tests to several projects, with special attention to high risk areas.
* Developing Azure DevOps build and release pipelines to create and enhance effective CI/CD workflows that ensure well maintained codebases and smooth application delivery.
* Being respected as a team member and viewed by colleagues as a technical expert.
