My day to day involved configuring ASP.NET Web Forms in an agile environment. In the front-end I worked with CSS, HTML, and JS, and VB.NET and XML for the back-end. I communicated with clients and partner organisations via email, and in meetings when necessary. My highlights include:

* First to receive a quarterly award, “Harlands Hero”, for work ethic and contribution. 
* Saved weeks of manual work using C# to transform data from Excel workbooks into Web Forms pages and XML configuration files. 
* Rapidly built, tested, documented, and deployed API integration for a major client which included enhanced promo code functionality. 
* Prototyped client facing CRM which interfaced with JIRA using ASP.NET MVC, Razor Forms, EntityFramework, Bootstrap. 
* Learned and used PowerBI & Power Query to deliver dynamic reports to Account Management, consuming data from JIRA’s REST API. 
* Documented implementation of social media optimisations for client payment portals, and built a WebForms User Control to simplify the process. 
* Administrated and streamlined JIRA workflows, and maintained issue quality and standards for reporting.
