I have over 7 years of experience building front and back-end applications that serve users around the world.
Iâ€™ve tackled challenges including internationalisation, performance, and data-security, and have delivered best-practice solutions in architectures ranging from monolithic to microservice, in technologies including React, NextJS, Angular, and .NET. I contually grow my development knowledge, build my own products, and participate in the development community through groups like [Brighton Alt.NET](http://brightonalt.net/), [.NET South East](http://www.dotnetsoutheast.co.uk/), and [Async](https://asyncjs.com/).

> Ferugi has been an important part of the Digital System team's ability to deliver quality software. He has written a good amount of code that will most likely stand the test of time.<br /> **He's undoubtedly one of our strongest developers.** <cite>David Haslam, Development Manager at INTO University Partnerships</cite>
