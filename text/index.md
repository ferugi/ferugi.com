# About Me
My name’s Ferugi, I’m a self taught software developer.

I see problems as challenges, and love to overcome them by learning and using technology. I also enjoy debugging and optimizing existing systems to see measured gains.

Offline I spend time achieving goals in the gym and ticking off books on my reading list. I firmly believe in working towards being a better version of myself tomorrow, than I am today.
